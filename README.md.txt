About This Project
Every private and government Service has its own contact number for an ambulance. . Different NGOs are having their ambulance services which are unknown to people. It becomes really hectic for a person to call all these numbers and ask for an ambulance. So, we thought of developing a Mobile app in which the patient will get to the nearest ambulance with a click of a button. The application will be a Mobile based application. Everyone nowadays has a mobile phone so any person in an emergency can call an ambulance by just enabling his location, without seeking the help of anyone. In this system, the patient or third person can call a toll-free number and they are assigned drivers to attend to the patient. In this situation, there is the devastation of time happening while discussions and also there is a big problem locating the location of the patient, high way and inside the place is very hard to locate the patient location. In this situation, the patient may have trouble. The tracking device sends information in the form of an SMS to the user, which does not give the precise position of the tracked vehicle. An accurate place of the tracked vehicle would not be provided by it. To conquer this framework creator made an answer. Sending SMS and tracking user location are the features supported by existing systems that would have been observed from the existing system. The involvement that which creator made resembled locates numerous vehicles area on Google Maps. This will be useful for the organization to simply track their vehicles. Furthermore, help the association to simply track their vehicles. And assist the organization to ban the criminal operations performed by the vehicle transporter. this is a secure and useful website.
